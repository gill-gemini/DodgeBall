# DodgeBall

**Descrition:**
Its a simple javascript breakout game from the mozilla javascript game tutorial[1].

Download the code , double click and start playing(html file). Use the left and right keys to hit the brick to max points without
colliding with bouncing balls. The game also works in smartphones.

Feel free to fork and add some thing to it .(send pull request)
